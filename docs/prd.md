🧵 Narrative

Imagine someone Googles your name — maybe a recruiter, a potential collaborator, or someone you met at a conference. They click the top link, and boom: they see a crisp, modern site with your face, your voice, and your work. In under 30 seconds, they get a sense of what you’re about, how to get in touch, and maybe even what makes you stand out.

This is your business card for the internet — but better looking and easier to update.
