          About Me

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          I obsess over the intersection of product, AI, and healthcare operations. Over the past 7+ years, I've had the privilege of scaling products that touch millions of patients and hundreds of hospitals—from optimizing supply chain visibility with IoT hardware to directing 7-person teams building LLM/RAG-based virtual agents. Every problem I solve starts with understanding the friction, and every solution I build puts user impact first.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          I thrive in the 0-1 and 1-N phases of product development where rapid iteration and customer obsession compound. Whether it's co-founding a healthcare startup, scaling novel AI capabilities, or driving enterprise product strategy—I'm drawn to work that fundamentally reshapes how healthcare operates and engages with patients.
